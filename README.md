⚡ Blinkit Sales Analytics: Interactive Business Dashboard (Excel Project)

1) Short Description / Purpose

🧮 Formulas & Logic: Employed for calculating core business metrics — Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating — and developing conditional logic for insights.

🎨 Custom Charting & Formatting: Used various chart types (Doughnut, Area, Bar) and advanced formatting to create a professional, engaging, single-screen dashboard view.
